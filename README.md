# Multi-Basin Calibration (MBC)
Multi-Basin Calibration method (MBC) to calibrate several neighboring and similar watersheds simultaneously in Low Data Environment (LDE).


## Description
This repository contains R codes for a project called **Watershed Model Parameter Estimation in Low Data Environments**. The study area is located within the Lake Champlain Basin (LCB) of Vermont (VT), USA. "USGS 04282650 - LOC-Ferrisburg", "USGS 04282629 - Little Otter Creek-Monkton" (LOC-Monkton), "USGS 04282586 - West Branch Dead Creek" (WBDC), and "USGS 04282581 - East Branch Dead Creek" (EBDC) are four watersheds located in the southern portion of LCB that were used to develop the model. LOC-Monkton, WBDC, and EBDC are three newly instrumented watersheds with short recorded streamflow data (26 months), and LOC-Ferrisburg has a longer recorded data (31 years of daily streamflow data). The R codes and datasets in this repository include:
